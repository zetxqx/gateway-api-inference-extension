# httproute_invalid_inferencepool_ref.yaml
# This manifest defines an HTTPRoute that references an InferencePool
# by name ("non-existent-inference-pool") which is intentionally NOT defined.
# The test will verify that the HTTPRoute reflects an appropriate
# failure status because the referenced InferencePool backend cannot be found.
