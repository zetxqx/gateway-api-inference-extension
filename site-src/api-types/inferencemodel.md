# Inference Model

??? example "Alpha since v0.1.0"

    The `InferenceModel` resource is alpha and may have breaking changes in
    future releases of the API.

## Background

An InferenceModel allows the Inference Workload Owner to define:

- Which Model/LoRA adapter(s) to consume.
  - Mapping from a client facing model name to the target model name in the InferencePool.
  - InferenceModel allows for traffic splitting between adapters _in the same InferencePool_ to allow for new LoRA adapter versions to be easily rolled out.
- Criticality of the requests to the InferenceModel.

## Spec

The full spec of the InferenceModel is defined [here](/reference/x-spec/#inferencemodel).
