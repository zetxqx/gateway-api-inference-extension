// FlowQueueAccessor represents the runtime state of a single active Flow.
//
// Role in Fairness:
// To a Fairness Policy, this interface represents a "Candidate": a distinct stream of requests that is competing for
// dispatch. The policy may inspect the state of this object (e.g., how many requests are waiting, how long they have
// been waiting, etc.) to decide if it should be the "Winner". Alternatively, it may operate on orthogonal state tracked
// for each FlowKey.
//
// Conformance: Implementations MUST ensure all methods are goroutine-safe.
type FlowQueueAccessor interface {
	QueueInspectionMethods

	// OrderingPolicy returns the policy implementation that rules this queue's internal ordering.
	// This allows fairness policies (like "global-strict-fairness-policy") to inspect the ordering logic when comparing
	// items across queues.

	// FlowKey returns the unique, immutable identity of the flow instance this queue belongs to.
	// This provides essential context (like the logical grouping ID and Priority) to policies.

// PriorityBandAccessor represents a Priority Band (conceptually, a 'Flow Group')—a collection of flows contending for
// resources at the same priority level.
//
// In the Endpoint Picker's hierarchy:
//  1. Incoming requests are mapped to a FlowKey.
//  2. All active flows sharing the same FlowKey.Priority are managed within this specific "Flow Group".
//  3. A FairnessPolicy is attached to this group to decide which flow within it gets the next dispatch attempt.
//
// This interface provides the read-only view required by the FairnessPolicy to inspect candidates and the state access
// required to implement the Flyweight pattern.
//
// Conformance: Implementations MUST ensure all methods are goroutine-safe.

	// This method allows the Stateless FairnessPolicy plugin (Singleton) to access its Stateful data (Scoped).
	// For example, a Round Robin policy uses this to retrieve the cursor indicating which flow was served last
	// in this specific group.
	//
	// Returns:
	//   - any: The opaque state object. This is guaranteed to be the exact object instance returned by the
	//     policy's NewState() method during initialization.
